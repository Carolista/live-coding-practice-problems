## Average Train Travel Times

#### Instructions to Interviewee
You should begin with an array of objects, each containing two properties: the speed a train is traveling and the distance it will cover. 

In `practice.js`, write a function that accepts the array of objects as input and returns the average time the trains take to reach their destinations. 

---
#### Hints & Clarifications
- time = distance / velocity
- It could be useful to write a helper function just to handle the calculation of time for a single train.

---
#### Test Data
- Train 1 - speed 20 mph, distance 150 miles
- Train 2 - speed 25 mph, distance 155 miles
- Train 3 - speed 32 mph, distance 162 miles

#### Expected Result
```
6.25416
```

---
#### Additional Prompts
Round the average time to two decimal places.
