#### Instructions to Interviewee
You're out shopping and your debit card is nowhere to be found! You dig around and find a few bills and coins. Is it enough? You'll have to do the math.

Write a function with two parameters â€” `amountNeeded` (number) and `currency` (object). The `currency` object that is passed in should have keys for different denominations of dollars (10 and below) and coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies). 

Your function should print `"Not enough money..."` if you cannot afford the purchase, or `"Cash it is!"` if you can.
