## FizzBuzz

#### Instructions to Interviewee
Write a function that accepts an integer, `n`, as input. For each number from 1 to `n`, print something according to the following rules:
- If the number is divisible by 3, print `"fizz"`.
- If the number is divisible by 5, print `"buzz"`.
- If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print `"fizzbuzz"`.
- If the number is not divisible by 3 or 5, just print the number itself.
