## Letter Usage

#### Instructions to Interviewee
Write a function that accepts a string as input. It should return an object with key/value pairs where each key is a unique character found in the string and the value is the number of times that character appears in the string.

---
#### Hints and Clarifications
- If a character does not appear in the string, it does not need to be included as a key in the object.
- Spaces are valid characters
