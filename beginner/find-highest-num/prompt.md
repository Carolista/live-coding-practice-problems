## Find Highest Number

#### Instructions to Interviewee
Write a function that accepts an array of integers as input. Return the index of the highest number in the array.

---
#### Hints and Clarifications
- The numbers might be negative.
- There might be only one number in the array, but there will always be at least 1.

---
#### Test Data
- `[3, -1, 9, 2, -4, 7, 6, 1, 5]`
- `[1]`
- `[-62, -79, -44, -22, -88]`

---
#### Expected Result
```
2 
0
3
```

---
#### Additional Prompts
Can you think of a way to solve this without looping over the array? (This will require knowledge of modern JS syntax.)
